<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>
Many researchers are confused about where they can get respondents to fulfill the data from their questions. To obtain appropriate and reliable data, researchers sometimes have difficulty distributing questionnaires independently. In addition, most researchers do not have much time to collect respondents. They tend to want to focus on data processing to obtain information quickly.

This project aims to make it easier for researchers to find the right respondent data according to the interests of each respondent. We hope a platform can simplify the process of filling out and submitting questionnaires.
